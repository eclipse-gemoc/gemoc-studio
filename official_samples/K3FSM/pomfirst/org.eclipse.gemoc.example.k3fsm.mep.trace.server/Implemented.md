Currently implemented:
  - initialize (notice the client about available capabilities)
  - launch (run model according to launch configuration)
  - step in (step into debug frame)
  - step out (step out of debug frame)
  - next (execute next debug frame)
  - set breakpoints (set line breakpoints)
  - continue (execute model until breakpoint or end)
  - variables (display defined variables (todo: should be tied to current frame))
  - stack trace (display the current stack of debug frames)
  - source (show the source of the currently executed model)
  - terminate (stop execution)
