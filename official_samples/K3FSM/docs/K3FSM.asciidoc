== K3FSM Example

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/official_samples/K3FM/docs/K3FSM_example.asciidoc.]


=== Presentation

This example features a simple executable language using GEMOC Java Engine.   

It illustrates the GEMOC animation framework on a Finite State Machine language where the concepts of both the syntax and semantic domains are in a single ecore file.   

The example focuses on the tooling of a single language (FSM) with the following tools:

* Tree editor,
* Xtext Editor,
* Graphical Sirius Editor,
* GEMOC Java Engine (Ie. using a Sequential approach)
* Model execution with debugging and animation capabilities

[NOTE]
====
In this example, the semantic domain is built as an extension of the syntaxic domain.

This might not be the case for all languages where the semantic domain may be structurally different from the semantic domain. 
==== 

You can either install and play with the example or reproduce it yourself from scratch by following the <<K3FSM-example-DIY>> instructions

[TIP]
====
The sources of these projects are also available online on https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/official_samples/K3FSM[Github].   
====

=== Installation

Install the projects of this language:

-         File > new  > Examples... > GEMOC K3 FSM Language example (Sequential)

Create and start an eclipse runtime:

-         Run  >  Run Configurations... > Eclipse application > new

Install sample models for the language:

-         File > new  > Examples... > GEMOC model example for K3 FSM  (Sequential)

=== Language structure overview
The following figure presents :

* the base language _fsm_ content;
* how the aspects extends the base classes;

[NOTE]
====
For simplification of the diagrams, the associations that doesn't represent a containment, are represented as attributes rather than links.
====

The elements with a green bullet in <<img-K3FSM_syntaxic_domain_and_semantic_domain>> are par of the semantic domain. This is the part of the model that will change  during the execution of a FSM model. Note that not all attribute are require for correct execution but provide nice feedback in the animation. (for example _consummedString_)


[[K3FSM-example-DIY]]
=== DIY

By following these instructions, you'll be able to reproduce this example from scratch.

* Open the xDSML perspective
* Create a GEMOC Sequential xDSML Project named "org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.xdsml"( Menu _File -> New -> GEMOC Sequential xDSML Project_) then _Next_ and select _Simple Sequential K3 language project_ -> Finish
* Right click on the project; _GEMOC Language_ ->  _Create Domain Model Project for Language_. Name this new project "org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm". Optionally adapt the nsUri.
    ** in the .dsl file, fix the _ecore_ entry by removing `platform:/resource/ecoreFilePath,` from the value.
* Edit the ecore file and add the concepts corresponding to the syntaxic domain (ie. reproduce concepts of <<img-K3FSM_syntaxic_domain_figure>>).

[[img-K3FSM_syntaxic_domain_figure]]
.FSM Syntaxic domain.
image::images/K3FSM/DIY/K3FSM_syntaxic_domain.png["FSM Syntaxic domain."]

* In the _org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm project_, open the *genmodel* file, 
    ** change the File extensions for the model to `k3fsmxmi`  (on the package: K3fsm -> K3fsm -> section Model)    
    ** Right click on the root element then _Generate model code_; _Generate edit code_; _Generate editor code_.

[TIP]
====
Variant: You create the ecore project before creating the xDSML project

Menu _File -> New -> Ecore Modeling Project then in the template wizard of the xdsml project creation, browse and select the ecore file in the project.
====

* Edit the ecore, to add the concepts for the semantic domain. Ie. the reference _currentState_, and teh attributes _unprocessedString_, _consummedString_, and _producedString_ as presented in <<img-K3FSM_syntaxic_domain_and_semantic_domain>>.
* Add an EAnnotation _aspect_ on the data that will change during the execution. In the FSM, add the EAnnotation on the reference _currentState_, and the attributes _unprocessedString_, _consummedString_ and, _producedString_ (aspect is the source of the EAnnotation)

* Reload the genmodel and generate the model, edit and editors.

* Rigth clik on the xdsml project; _GEMOC Language_ ->  _Create XText Editor Project for Language_. Add the genmodel to the list of EPackages; Name this new project "org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.xtext"; use "org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.K3FSM" as name for the language, and "k3fsm" as extensions.
   ** in the xtext editor:
   *** change the import from "http://www.eclipse.org/gemoc/example/k3fsm" to
"platform:/resource/org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm/model/k3fsm.ecore"
   *** comment out the line about _incomingTransitions_ (useless as this is a bidirectionnal reference and as we use _target_ to store this information)
   *** in the _GenerateK3FSM.mwe2_ file, verify that then genmodel is referenced with a correct uri; someting like this `referencedResource = "platform:/resource/org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm/model/k3fsm.genmodel"`
   *** right click; _Run As_ -> _MWE2 Workflow_
   

* Rigth clik on the xdsml project; _GEMOC Language_ ->  _Create DSA Project for Language_. Next -> Select "User Ecore Basic Aspect"; Set "Aspet file name" to "K3FSMAspects".

    ** in the .dsl file, fix the _k3_ entry by removing `qualified.class.name,` from the value.
    ** edit the k3fsmAspect.xtend file and add the following methods in the aspects:
    

[source,k3,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------
include::../language_workbench/org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.k3dsa/src/org/eclipse/gemoc/example/k3fsm/k3dsa/k3fsmAspects.xtend[]
-------------------------------------------

<1> a method with _@InitializeModel_ annotation in order to use the launch configuration parameters to set up the runtime data when the model execution starts.
<2> a method with _@Main_ annotation that will be used to start the execution.
<3> a method with the _@Step_ annotation that will be observable (ie. the debugger can do a pause when a object instance of this class call this method).
<4>  another method with the _@Step_ annotation that will be observable
    

    ** Verify that the project _org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.xdsml_ has a dependency to the project that contains the K3 aspects ( _org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.k3dsa_)

* Create a project for the graphical editor: File -> New -> Viewpoint Specification Project 
* Create a representation for edition
    ** Change viewpoint name to "K3FSMViewPoint", label "K3FSM"
    ** New Diagram representation; set the ID to "FSM", add the k3fsm.ecore to the list of metamodels; set the domain class to the FSM class. In Advanced, set the title expression to "feature:name"
    ** in the Default layer; _New Diagram Element_ -> _Container_; ID = "StateContainer"; Domain class = "State"; Semantic candidate expression = `[self.ownedStates/]`
    *** on the _StateContainer_; _New Style_ -> _Gradient_ 
    *** on the _StateContainer_; _New Contitional style_;  Predicate expression = `[self.eContainer().oclAsType(StateMachine).initialState = self/]`; create another gradient in it and set a border size to 4.
    ** in the Default layer; _New Diagram Element_ -> _Element Based Edge_; ID = "TranditionEdge"; Domain class = "Transition"; Source mapping = "StateContainer"; source finder expression = `[self.source/]`; target Mapping = "StateContainer"; Target Finder Expression = `[self.target/]`
    *** On _TranditionEdge_/ Edge Style solid, verify the decorators, No decoration for source arrow, and InputArrow for Target Arrow
    *** On _TranditionEdge_/ _Edge Style solid_ / _Center Label Style 8_; Label Expression = `aql:self.getLabel()`
    ** Open the file _org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.design.Services_; add a method: (use Eclipse quick fix to add the import to 
`import org.eclipse.gemoc.example.k3fsm.Transition;` )
