== LegacyFSM Sequential example

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/official_samples/sample.deployers/plugins/org.eclipse.gemoc.sequential.language.wb.sample.deployer/docs/LegacyFSM_sequential.asciidoc.]




=== Presentation

This example features an executable language using GEMOC Sequential Engine.   

It illustrates the GEMOC animation framework on a Finite State Machine language.   

The example focuses on the separation of the base language: FSM and the executable sequential language: XSFSM.     

The tree editor and graphic editor are defined on top of the FSM language. They are considered as if they were pre-existing (Ie. legacy).     

Then, Melange is used to built the XSFSM executable language by inheriting from FSM. The animation layer is also built as an extensions of the graphical editor. 

This allows to use the model polymorphism. Ie. it is possible to edit FSM models and then run them as XSFSM with the appropriate animation extensions. 

More information and the sources of these projects are available online on https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/official_samples/LegacyFSM[Github].

=== Language structure overview
The following figure presents :

* the base language _fsm_ content;
* how the aspects extends the base classes;
* how the _xsfsm_ language is built by inheriting from the _fsm_ language and using the aspects.
