         Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
         This example features an executable language using GEMOC Sequential Engine.   
      </p>
      <p>
         It illustrates the GEMOC animation framework on a Finite State Machine language.   
      </p>
      <p>
         The example focuses on the separation of the base language: FSM and the executable sequential language: XSFSM.     
      </p>
      <p>
         The tree editor and graphic editor are defined on top of the FSM language. They are considered as "legacy", ie. pre-existing.     
      </p>
      <p> 
         Then, Melange is used to built the XSFSM executable language by inheriting from FSM. The animation layer is also built as an extensions of the graphical editor. 
      </p>
      <p> 
         This allows to use the model polymorphism. Ie. it is possible to edit FSM models and then run them as XSFSM with the appropriate animation extensions. 
      </p>
