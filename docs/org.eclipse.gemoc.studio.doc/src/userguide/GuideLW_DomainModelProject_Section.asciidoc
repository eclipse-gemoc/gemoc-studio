=== Defining a Domain Model Project

==== Purpose
The Domain Model Project specifies the concepts of the domain at hand and the structural relations between the concepts.

==== Creating the Domain Model Project
The GEMOC Studio relies on the Eclipse Modeling Framework for its Domain Model Projects. See http://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/[the EMF website] for more information on how to create an EMF project in Eclipse. The Domain Model is materialized as an Ecore metamodel.

When your EMF Project is done, connect your xDSML Project to it by specifying in the _.melange_ file the path to your Ecore metamodel thanks the keyword *syntax*.
See <<section-melange-editor>> for more informations about Melange keywords and the content assist.

==== Editing the Domain Model Project
If you wish to modify your Domain Model, do not forget to reload the associated genmodel and regenerate the EMF model code (and edit/editor code if you use them).
