As the GEMOC Studio offer different engines that requires specific configurations, it currently offers one launch configuration per engine.
The views offered when running or debugging a model will also vary depending on the execution mode and the engine kind.

The GEMOC Studio currently embed 2 engines:
- a sequential engine with its launch configuration
- a concurrent engine with its launch configuration

Both launch configurations offer a Run and a Debug mode.
