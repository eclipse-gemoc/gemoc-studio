== Overview

The *((GEMOC Language Workbench))* is intended to be used by the ((Language Designer))s and the ((Language Integrator))s. It provides the tools to create and compose eXecutable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (xDSMLs) using the GEMOC approach.

[[make-language-executable-chapter]]
== Make a language executable

The GEMOC Studio currently supports two major ways to make a language executable :

* one will target a sequential engine 
* the second will target a concurrent engine

[NOTE]
====
The underlying executionframework used by the GEMOC Studio can be extended to support other methodologies or engines. 
However, this isn't the scope of this document to explain how to use this framework and build an alternate or dedicated engine.
