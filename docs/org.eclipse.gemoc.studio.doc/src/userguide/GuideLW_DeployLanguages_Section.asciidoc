Eclipse propose several way to deploy and distribute the language created using the GEMOc approach. The most appropriate method will depent on the main usage.

Basicaly it consist in launching the plugins of the language using PDE (Plugin Development Environment) offerd by Eclipse. 

Some Eclipse articles describe this process:

* https://eclipse.org/articles/Article-PDE-does-plugins/PDE-intro.html
* http://www.eclipse.org/articles/Article-EMF-goes-RCP/rcp.html

=== Deployment of languages for the Language designer
The language designer can test the language he is designing by launching a new Eclipse runtime from his development workbench.

This is done by creating a run configuration. Select "run / run Configurations" Double click on "Eclipse Application" and change the name "New Configuration" into "<YourSuperLanguage> Modeling Workbench". We can now click "Run" to start the new runtime Eclipse which indeed corresponds to the Modeling Workbench for your language.

TIP: This mode offer some fine control. For example, it is possible to put breakpoint in the DSA code in order to finely develop them.

=== Distribution of languages to the Model designer

Distributing the language concist in distributing the plugins. This typically could be done via an https://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_create_an_update_site_%28site.xml%29%3F[update site] or a full eclipse package (https://wiki.eclipse.org/Rich_Client_Platform[RCP application]).

* The update site will allow to install the language in an existing Eclipse.
* The RCP methodoly will allow to create an application with a dedicated set of plugins including the language. This application could look like a classic eclipse IDE (including java, etc) or be completly customized for a given purpose by providing only required tools.


TIP: Once the updatesite or product have been defined, you may need to automate the build. The current best practice is to use https://eclipse.org/tycho/[Tycho]. (see also some good http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html[tutorial] about this on internet.
