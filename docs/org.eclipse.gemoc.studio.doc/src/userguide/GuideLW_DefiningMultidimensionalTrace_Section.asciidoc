=== Defining Multidimentional Trace support

The multidimentional trace is a mecanism that enable some extra feature in the debugger in the Modeling workbench.
This turns the debugger into an omniscient debugger with forward/backward features and advanced visualization of data changes in the model.

This feature can be enabled by using the generator on top of the xdsml project and generate the _Trace Addon Project_.


TODO complete this section.
