==== Define an animation representation using an engine addon
footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/docs/org.eclipse.gemoc.studio.doc/src/main/asciidoc/userguide/lw_DefineModelAnimation_using_engine_addon.asciidoc.]

GEMOC offers an API to develop Engine Addons. These addons have access to the engine 
execution context, the model and its runtime data. As they are refreshed during the 
execution, they are convenient to provide many services including animated UI for 
representing the model. 

For example, they will easily connect to a dedicated Eclipse view.

[TIP]
====
An Engine addon may be generic and apply to any language, but it can also be 
language specific. In that case, you should prefer to add its code in the project 
containing the dsl file of the language and declare it in the plugin.xml.


This way, the addon will be available only for this specific language.
