Let's focus on the language semantics. Ie. what each models of the language means.


The GEMOC Studio currently supports two major ways to make a language executable :

* one will target a sequential engine 
* the second will target a concurrent engine

[NOTE]
====
The underlying executionframework used by the GEMOC Studio can be extended to support other methodologies or engines. 
However, this isn't the scope of this document to explain how to use this framework and build an alternate or dedicated engine.
