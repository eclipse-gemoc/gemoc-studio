Debug RunTime Data information used by the views in the Debug perspective 
are driven by the declaration of which data in the model can change during the model execution
with regard to the part of the model that do not change.

Basically, this means that the elements in ecore of the language that can change during the execution
 must be annotated with *aspect* annotation.

The elements tagged with this will be treated as mutable and used by the various part of the studio
 when deployed in the modeling workbench.
This includes for example the <<userguide-mw-variables-view, Variables view>>, the 
 <<userguide-mw-multidimentional-timeline-view, MultiDimentional timeline view>>, the trace, ...

<<figure-model-debug-RTD-using-aspect-annotation>> shows a basic usage of this annotation on the example <<K3FSM-example>>
and its effect on the Variables view and Multidimentional Timeline view in <<figure-model-debug-RTD-using-aspect-annotation-effect-in-mwb>>.

NOTE: Melange can help to set these annotations. If you are using Melange in order to generate the executable language from a non executable ecore then
 this annotation is automatically added for you on every element added thanks to aspects.
