GEMOC framework offer to language and/or engine developers the possibility to create Engine Addons (see <<dev-new-addons>>).
An Engine addon will connect to the running engine and all its data (model, context, etc) in order to provide new features 
to the end user who run a model (ie. model designer).

These addons may work in the background (for example for recording traces) but can also provide a 
graphical user interface.

These GUI can then provide dedicated backends or frontends views that respectively display informations from 
the running model or provide event input to the running model.

The activation or not of an addon is done in the *Engine Addons* tab.

When selected, an addon (and its optional associated views) will be activated in both run and debug mode.

For example in <<img-engine_addons_configuration-userguide>>, selecting the a 
_MultiDimentional Trace_ addon will enable the storing of the execution trace 
and thus allow to use the MultiDimentionnal timeline view. 
In this example, the user has the choice between the _Generic MultiDimentional Trace_ 
addon and the language specific _k3fsm MultiDimentional Trace_ addon (more efficient) 
generated thanks to the trace addon generator (see <<defining-multidimensional-trace-project-section>>). 


NOTE: If most addons can be used for every languages, some addons may be developed for a single language or for a single engine.
