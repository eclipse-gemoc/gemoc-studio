Providing model animation mainly consist in offering representations (textual, graphical, tabular, or 
even specialized views) for the data that changes during model execution (ie. RunTime Data).

As opposed to Debug representation (see <<defining-a-debug-representation-section>>), Animation is supposed to be available in all execution modes 
(both *Run mode* and *Debug mode*). 


As for concrete syntaxes, GEMOC supports several technologies, including graphical editor extension, in semantic direct call or engine addons.
