In order to run a model using the headless runner, the plugins that define the language must be 
placed in a location where the runner will be able to find them. 


=== Installing jars in _dropins_ folder

The easiest way to install a language is to copy the jars in the _dropins_ folder of the studio (headless or IDE).
Eclipse will automatically find them and add them.


[WARNING]
====
Using the _dropins_ folder is handy but in case of trouble (typically dependency or java version issue),
the jars will be silently ignored by default. Have a look in 
<<userguide-headless-debug-deployment-issues>> in order to get tips about how to detect and solve them.

=== Installing jars using the p2 director

If the jars have been packaged as an update site, you can use the p2 director 
application to install them in an existing eclipse from the command line.

See https://help.eclipse.org/2018-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Fguide%2Fp2_director.html


=== Installing jars using the `--installLanguage` option

TO BE IMPLEMENTED

=== Debugging language deployment issues


Here are series of tips and thing you must verify in case of troubles.


. check that your language correctly works in the Modeling Workbench launched in development (ie. starting a second eclipse
from the language workbench as described in <<deploy-language-for-language-designer-section>>.)
. Verify that the language is correctly detected using `--list-languages` option.
. Verify that the plugins are correctly installed using OSGI console
.. launch the studio using the following options: +
   `./GemocStudioHeadless -console -noExit -debug --list-languages`  
... the `-debug` option associated to the `.options` file in the root of the studio installation
    will increase the number of messages related to the management of jars in the _dropins_ folder.
    (Unfortunatly, these messages are still unclear and you should try the next tip)
.... content of the `.options` file +
    `org.eclipse.equinox.p2.core/debug=true` +
    `org.eclipse.equinox.p2.core/reconciler=true`
... the `-console -noExit` options allow to start the OSGI console and query the installation about its status.
  Once you get the `+<OSGI>+` prompt you can try the following commands: (Note: the stdio of several threads 
  are mixed up, so you may need to type _Enter_ to get the prompt). (Note2: in OSGI, Bundle means Eclipse plugin)
.... `help` gets help about all OSGI commands
.... `ss` and `ss <partOfYourPluginsName>` lists the installed bundles (ie. plugins) and their status.
.... `install file:<pathToYourJar>` or `install reference:file:<pathToYourJar>` manually installs a missing jar (useful when dropins reconciler ignored 
  a given jar due to dependency issue). (Note: relative path is accepted)
.... `diag <BundleID>` check a given plugin for dependency issue
.... `start <BundleId>` start the plugin. this is useful since some plugin may not declare any dependecy issue but crash on start. 
 . Verify that the jar content of the plugins is correct. +
   Ie. in development mode, Eclipse uses the folder containing the source 
   as input for the second workbench, however when creating the jar (which is actually a zip archive)
   it may not copy everything (for example, it doesn't contain java files but only class files...).
   Additional resources may be missing if not correctly specified. Typical missing resources are: +
   plugin.xml, `xxx.dsl` file, `model/xxx.ecore` file, `model/xxx.genmodel` file, libs, images, ... +
   Specifying jar content is done via the _MANIFEST.MF/Build.properties_ editor in the _Build_ tab.

If you think that some missing plugin should be part of the Headless package, please
file a bug in https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/issues .   

[NOTE]
====
The Headless studio does not contains Eclipse UI, thus plugins requiring 
it will not work in it. If for some reason you *really* need UI components 
while launching a model execution from command line, then you may
consider using the `-application` option directly on a standard GEMOC Studio.
