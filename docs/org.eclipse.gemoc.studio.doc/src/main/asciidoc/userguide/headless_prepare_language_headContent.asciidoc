==== Prepare language

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/docs/org.eclipse.gemoc.studio.doc/src/main/asciidoc/userguide/headless_prepare_language_headContent.asciidoc.]


In order to run a model using the headless runner, the plugins that define the language must be prepared for distribution
and then be placed in a location where the runner will be able to find them. 

Roughly, this task is similar to <<userguide-lw-deploy-language>>.

Actually this consist in creating deployable jars of the plugins. These jars can be generated in several ways:

===== Create deployable jars using Eclipse UI

In the Language Workbench where you have developped the language.

* Select the projects, _File -> Exports..._, _Plug-in development -> Deployabe plug-ins and fragments -> Next_
* Select the destination Directory

The directory will typically be the _dropins_ folder of the headless studio.

===== Create deployable jars using Maven

You can automate the production of the deployable jars using maven and https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/documentation.php[tycho].

Good tutorial can be found on the web. For example, http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseTycho/article.html

[TIP]
====
For simple project, you can even use a very limited number of pom.xml files by using 
the tycho POM-less structure. See http://blog.vogella.com/2015/12/15/pom-less-tycho-builds-for-structured-environments/
