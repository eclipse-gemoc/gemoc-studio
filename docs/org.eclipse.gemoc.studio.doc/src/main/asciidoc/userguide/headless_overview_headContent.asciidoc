GEMOC can also run without graphical user interface. It offers a command line 
interface allowing to automate some task.

Additionally, a specific package is available in order to decrease the size on disk (and hopefully in memory too).
This specific package can be downloaded at ???

IMPORTANT: TODO add final link

[TIP]
====
All commands works on both packages (Full IDE or Headless). 
When running on the full IDE you must precise 
that you do not want to launch the UI and want to launch the EngineRunner application using the `+-noSplash+` and `+-application+` options.

./GemocStudio -noSplash -application org.eclipse.gemoc.gemoc_studio.headless.EngineRunner <engineRunner parameters>

The commands take the following form:

===== Eclipse specific options overview
We have selected the use of the following eclipse specific options:

* `-clean` Any cached data used by the OSGi framework and eclipse runtime will be wiped clean. 
This will clean the caches used to store bundle dependency resolution and eclipse extension registry data. Using this option will force eclipse to reinitialize these caches.
* `-clearPersistedState` Removes any cached state of the user interface and reloads the model
* `-console` The OSGi console is enabled. This is handy for investigating the state of the system and analyze deployment issues.
* `-debug`   The platform is put in debug mode. If the value is a string it is interpreted as 
the location of the .options file. This file indicates what debug points are available for a plug-in and whether or not they are enabled. If a location is not specified, 
the platform searches for the .options file under the install directory.
* `-noExit` The OSGi Framework will not be shut down after the Eclipse application has ended. 
This is useful for examining the OSGi Framework (using `-console`) after the Eclipse application has ended. 

(A complete list of eclipse specific options is available at 
 https://help.eclipse.org/2018-12/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fruntime-options.html ).
