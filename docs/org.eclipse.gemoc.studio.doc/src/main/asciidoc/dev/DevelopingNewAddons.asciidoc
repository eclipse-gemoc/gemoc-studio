==== Developing new Addons

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/docs/org.eclipse.gemoc.studio.doc/src/main/asciidoc/dev/DevelopingNewAddons.asciidoc.]

GEMOC addons mecanism is the simpliest way to contribute new features to GEMOC. Most of the features in GEMOC have been developed using it.

Basically, it uses Eclipse plugin extension point in order to provide additional feature to an existing engine.

The main extension point is `org.eclipse.gemoc.gemoc_language_workbench.engine_addon` which allows to declare a new class that implements the `IEngineAddon` interface.


===== Create an Addon

Minimal steps to get an addons:

- Create a plugin project (or contribute to an existing one)
- In the MANIFEST.MF or plugin.xml editor, open the _extensions_ tab, Add, uncheck "Show only extension from the required plugins", search for "gemoc" and select the `org.eclipse.gemoc.gemoc_language_workbench.engine_addon` extension point, accept to add the dependency to the plugin. (see <<img-New_Extension_4_Engine_Addon_screenshot-devguide>>)
- add an _addon_ entry in the extension point (see <<img-EngineAddon_extension_point_details_screenshot-devguide>>) provide a name and a description that will help the end user to know if she wish to enable the addon or not in the launch tab when configuring her model execution.
- Create the class implementing _org.eclipse.gemoc.xdsmlframework.api.engine_addon.IEngineAddon_ (a click on Class*: in the extension editor allows to open a wizard that simplify this task)
- you can now override any of the default methods of the interface (cf. <<img-FrameworkCommons-overview-CD-devguide>>). If the user select the addon in the launch tab, these methods will be called by the engine.

[TIP]
====
An Engine addon may be generic and apply to any language, but it can also be 
language specific. In that case, you should prefer to add its code in the project 
containing the dsl file of the language and declare it in the plugin.xml.


This way, the addon will be available only for this specific language.

[[img-add_engine_addons_on_dsl]]
.Add language specific Engine Addon on DSL 
image::images/dev/New_Extension_4_Engine_Addon_in_dsl_screenshot.png["Add language specific Engine Addon on DSL", 700]

This can be useful in order to create language specific GUI (with input/output) 
and complex model animation. (see <<define-animation-representation-using-engine-addon-section>>)
====

[TIP]
====
In the extension declaration, setting _Default_ to _true_ will activate the addon by default when creating a new launch configuration. The user is still able to disable the addon manually.
==== 


===== Controling call to addon

[NOTE]
====
The calls from the engine to the methods of IEngineAddons block the model execution. Thus, except if this is the expected behavior, the addons  should avoid to do complex/long running/blocking task directly in the  
====   



For a given notification to _IEngineAddon_ (for example aboutToExecuteStep), the order of calls to all registered addons is by default not ensured.

However,  an addon can declare some _EngineAddonSortingRule_ in order to indicate if the addon mus be called before or after another addon for a given _EngineEvent_.

The other addon can be identified either via its id or any tag that has been associated to it. 

[TIP]
====
When starting a model execution the console logs some informations about which addon has been enabled and when each addon will be called compared to other addons.
==== 


The implicit GemocDebug addon is in charge to lock the execution when it receives a pause command.
Addons that displays some information on the UI may wish to be called before it in order to make sure to provide
updated information.

This snippet show how to add a rule that enforce this.
[source,java]
----

public class MyAddon implements IEngineAddon {

	@Override
	public void aboutToExecuteStep(IExecutionEngine<?> engine, Step<?> logicalStepToApply) {
		// do some refresh action 
	}
	
	@Override
	public List<EngineAddonSortingRule> getAddonSortingRules() {  <1>
		ArrayList<EngineAddonSortingRule> sortingRules = new ArrayList<EngineAddonSortingRule>();
		sortingRules.add(new EngineAddonSortingRule( this,
				EngineAddonSortingRule.EngineEvent.aboutToExecuteStep,
				EngineAddonSortingRule.Priority.BEFORE,
				Arrays.asList(IGemocDebugger.GROUP_TAG))); <2>
		return sortingRules;
	}
}
----
<1> create a rule to ensure good behavior with GemocDebugger. The debugger addon will stop the execution in this event, this make sure to be called before it in order to properly do the task (refresh the view, save info, etc)
<2> use the group tag so this rule will work with any GemocDebugger implementation.
