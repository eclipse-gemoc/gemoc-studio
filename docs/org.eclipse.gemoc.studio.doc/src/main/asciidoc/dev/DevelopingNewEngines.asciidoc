As seen in <<img-ComponentsOverview-devguide>>, the framework is organized in several layers. The most complete layer is the GEMOC Framework which offers most of the advanced features. Thus, implementing an engine for a new technology consist in 2 main parts:

* implementing subclasses for the classes from XDSML Framework in order to have the part dedicated to the Language Workbench,
* and  implementing subclasses for the classes from Execution Framework in order to have the part dedicated to the Modeling Workbench
