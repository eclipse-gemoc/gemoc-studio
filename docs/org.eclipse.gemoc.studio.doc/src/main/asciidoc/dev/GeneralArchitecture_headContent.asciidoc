As shown in <<img-GEMOCStudioGeneralArchitecture-MainFeatures-devguide>>, the GEMOC Studio offers several main features for the Modeling workbench and the Language Workbench. Both share features coming from the execution platform.

Each component presented in this figure is actually refined depending on the technology used when implementing a given language. For example, if for a language, the Domain Specific Action (DSA) is expressed using K3, the _Engine_ will use the code produced by the _K3 DSA Compiler_. 
If for another language, the DSA is expressed using ALE, then the Engine will use an _ALE DSA Interpreter_.

[NOTE]
====
The components shown in the _Concurrent_ boxes are specific to the concurrent approach. This approach is not yet officially included in the Studio but is already available in the Discovery service.
