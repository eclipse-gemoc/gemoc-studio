The GEMOC Studio is distributed with a set of official examples that are regularly verified.

These examples use two installers. 

* One installer is dedicated to create the language projects in the Language workbench. image:images/icons/IconeGemocLanguage_16.png[width=16, height=16, role=right]
* The second installed is dedicated to create example model of the language in the modeling workbench. image:images/icons/IconeGemocModel_16.png[width=16, height=16, role=right]


All installers are available in the corresponding Eclipse via the menu: _File_ -> _new_  -> _Examples..._ 
Then make sure to select the examples in the _GEMOC language workbench examples_ group or in the
_GEMOC modeling workbench examples_ group depending on your workbenches.

[WARNING]
.Warning
=====================================================================
When installing in the language and modeling workbenches, make sure to select the correct
corresponding pair of projects, since even if they may have similar language names, models for a given
language may not be compatible with another language.
=====================================================================

Several examples documentation contain a DIY section. 
This DIY section provides tutorial material allowing to manually reproduce the language workbench projects step-by-step.

- on github (some of them are listed in https://gemoc.org/tutorial.html and https://gemoc.org/gallery.html)
