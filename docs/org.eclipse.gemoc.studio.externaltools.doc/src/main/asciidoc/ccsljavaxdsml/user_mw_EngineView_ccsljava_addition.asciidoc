The CCSLJava engine adds some commands to the Engine view.

It adds a new button (represented as a shield on top right of <<img-engine-view-ccsljava-addition>>) that allows
to change the current Logical Step decider used by the CCSLJava engine.

[TIP]
====
When running a model, You can easily "pause" the engine running with a solver or random decider 
by clicking on the change logical step decider (the shield button will be green when run in debug mode) 
this will automatically switch to the "Step by step decider". To restart, simply select back an automatic 
decider (solver or random) and select the next step in the <<mw-executing-concurrent-model-logical-steps-view-section, LogicalStep view>>.
====

[WARNING]
====
Even if they both pause the execution, choosing a "Step by step decider" is currently different 
from the "suspend" of a breakpoint from the <<userguide-mw-debug-commands-view, Debug commands>>. The former ask the user for a decision about the logical step to execute and the later
suspends the execution in order to analyze it. 

Help is welcome to contribute a way to align them.
