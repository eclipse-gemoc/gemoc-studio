Formerly known as _Event Scheduling Timeline view_, this view represents the lines of the model's execution with a 
focus for concurrent behavior and LogicalSteps events. It displays:

* the different logical steps proposed by the solver in the past in blue color,
* the selected logical steps at each execution step in green color,
* and the possible future logical steps in yellow color,
* the model specific events for each logical step.

[NOTE]
====
This view can be enabled/disabled in the launch configuration by checking "Execution tracing" in the Engine Addons tab.
====

[NOTE]
====
The possible future logical steps are shown under the condition that the model is executing.

In addition to displaying information, it also provides interaction with the user. During execution, it is possible to come back into the past by double-clicking on any of the blue logical steps. It does three things:

. it resets the solver's state to the selected execution step,
. and it resets the model's state to the selected execution step,
. it also forks the current timeline and create a new branch of execution.

It is also possible to select a logical step and use the contextual menu to show its caller in the Sirius editor:
