The Stimuli Manager View is provided by the CCSLJava Engine.

The Stimuli Manager view display the list of MSE and has interactions with the Logical Steps view.

When selecting an MSE you can constrain it by clicking on :

* Green down arrow : no user constraint for this MSE in the next LogicalStep
* Orange down arrow : forbid tick of this MSE in the next LogicalStep. The solver will propose only solutions where this MSE doesn't tick.
* Orange up : force tick of this MSE in the next LogicalSteps. The solver will propose only solutions where this MSE ticks.

Depending of your choice, the list of proposals will be changed in the Logical Steps view.

Moreover selecting an element in the Logical Steps view will highlight the MSE involved in the Stimuli Manager view.

[TIP]
====
This Stimuli Manager view can be used to manually simulate external events.
