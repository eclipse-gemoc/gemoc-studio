===== Logical step view

footnote:[asciidoc source of this page:  https://github.com/eclipse/gemoc-studio/tree/master/docs/org.eclipse.gemoc.studio.externaltools.doc/src/main/asciidoc/ccsljavaxdsml/user_mw_ControlModelExecution_LogicalStepView.asciidoc.]

The Logical Step View is provided by the CCSLJava Engine.

The logical steps view displays the list of possible future executions. This list is provided by the solver. This view is organized around a tree. For each logical step, its underlying events can be seen and possibly for each event the associated operation is visible. 

[NOTE]
====
This view displays nothing when execution runs in "run mode", per say this view is only of use when running in "debug mode".
