This package gathers system tests that correspond to user features of the **Language Workbench**.

These tests covers the various ways to interact with the studio for a given 
feature (ie. the various ways to achieve a step of a scenario).


As opposed to user stories, they usually start with some data/projects. 
The method test order is not supposed to be important (be careful to the @Before/@After)


The following table tries to list the features, which test implement it and where is the user documentation.
