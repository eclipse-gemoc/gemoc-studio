This package gathers system tests that correspond to user stories for the **Language Workbench**.

A user story test suite (class) typically starts by an empty workspace and ends with a fully functional language.

The test are organized as scenarios (ie. the test method order is important and reflects the major steps of the scenario) 

This typically includes scenarios for tutorial, etc.


Note: If some variant are possible in the UI, they are supposed to be handled 
by dedicated tests in the *org.eclipse.gemoc.studio.tests.system.lwb.feature* package.
