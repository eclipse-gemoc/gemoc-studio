On the Globalization of Modeling Languages\n\
The GEMOC Studio is a modeling and simulation framework for heterogeneous systems. \
The studio integrates consistently various existing Eclipse plugins for designing and \
implementing executable and concurrent domain-specific modeling languages. \
It also provides unique features to specify composition operators between (possibly heterogeneous) DSMLs. \
Such specifications are amenable to support the edition, execution, graphical animation and analysis of heterogeneous models.\n\
This studio is proposed by the GeMoc Initiative.\n\
