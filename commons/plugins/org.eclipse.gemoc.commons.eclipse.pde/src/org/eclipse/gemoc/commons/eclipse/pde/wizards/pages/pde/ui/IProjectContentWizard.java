/**
 * Classes that implement this interface are contributed via the extension point
 * <code>org.eclipse.pde.ui.pluginContent</code>. The expectation is that
 * classes also extend JFace Wizard class. The role of this wizard is to provide
 * additional plug-in content after the project and the critical plug-in project
 * files have been created. The wizard is nested in the overall 'New' wizard and
 * can contribute one or more pages that allow users to configure how this
 * content will be generated. A typical implementation of this interface would
 * be a template wizard that populates the plug-in project with content that can
 * be useful right away (for example, a view or an editor extension).
 * <p>
 * Due to the call order of the method <code>performFinish</code> in nested
 * wizards, classes that implement this interface should not place the code that
 * generates new content in the implementation of the abstract method
 * <code>Wizard.performFinish()</code>. Instead, they should simply return
 * <code>true</code> and have all the real code in <code>performFinish</code>
 * defined in this interface. This version of the method passes all the context
 * required for the content generation and is called AFTER the project and vital
 * plug-in files have been already created.
 * 
 * @noextend This interface is not intended to be extended by clients.
 * @since 3.0
